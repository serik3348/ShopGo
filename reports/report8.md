REPORT 8:

The Team members: Serik Onbolsyn

Progress: In last week I did filtering and rating system.

To do it firstly we had a function where it takes all data from database in sql statement.
To sort them we just make sql statement where it shows order and it accepts ordr type from user that will input filer type

For rating system we create new table where items id and id in rating table will have join statement
The rating table will consist of only two columns (id ,rating)
, rating will have 5 scale rating and program will just calculate average of all users rating average with 2 decimal after point


I still have some issues to implement comments because I concentrated on easy parts such as rating and filter

For next week:

End comments code implementation,fully work rating system and starting the final task as users and purchasing items
