REPORT 8:

The Team members: Serik Onbolsyn

Progress: In last week midterm2 tasks were done.

I just ended comment section and its methods ,now i am going to start final project tasks such publish items,role and purchase

To publish items i will just create form and function to accept data and create sql statement with those datas so i will have new item, also only seller will be able to do it.

For roles i think i will add new column to table users like a 'type' so some functions will be able to some type of users. It means when the user will call function then program will check  does this person allowed to do such a things.

For purchasing items i will check info from internet how to implement it in website cuz i do not know yet how to do it
